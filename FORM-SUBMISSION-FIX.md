# üö® Form Submission Error - CRITICAL FIX

## Current Error:
```
Submission Failed
An error occurred. Please try again or call us directly.
Booking form error: n: API request failed
```

## ‚úÖ Good News - CSP Fixed!

All Content Security Policy errors are now resolved:
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Clarity scripts loading
- ‚úÖ reCAPTCHA connecting to Google
- ‚úÖ API client using correct production URL (no more localhost:3000 error)

## ‚ùå Problem: Missing API Keys in Vercel

The form submission is failing because **required API keys are not configured in Vercel environment variables**.

You mentioned you added API keys to Vercel, but you need **THREE different sets of keys**:

### Required API Keys:

1. **Google Maps API Key** ‚úÖ (You already added this)
   - Variable: `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
   - Value: `AIzaSyDW5O_4hPO0A2iFhLj73Rz8S6LSBUQGatA`

2. **Google reCAPTCHA Keys** ‚ùå (Missing - causing form failure)
   - Variable: `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
   - Variable: `GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`
   - Get from: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create

3. **Resend Email API Key** ‚ùå (Missing - emails won't send)
   - Variable: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Get from: https://resend.com/api-keys

## üéì Why Forms Are Failing

Your forms require **3 steps** to work:

1. **Client-side validation** ‚úÖ Working
2. **reCAPTCHA verification** ‚ùå Missing keys
3. **Email notification** ‚ùå Missing keys

The API endpoint is working correctly, but it needs these keys to:
- Verify the user is not a bot (reCAPTCHA)
- Send email notifications to you (Resend)
- Send confirmation emails to customers (Resend)

Without these keys, the API returns an error and the form fails.

## üîê Important Notes

### reCAPTCHA v3 vs v2:
- ‚úÖ Use **reCAPTCHA v3** - Invisible, no checkboxes
- ‚ùå Don't use reCAPTCHA v2 - Requires clicking checkboxes

### Resend Email Setup:
After getting your Resend API key, you need to:
1. **Verify your domain** in Resend (optional but recommended)
2. Or use Resend's default sending domain initially

For now, you can skip domain verification and emails will send from `onboarding@resend.dev` with your `FROM_EMAIL` in the reply-to field.

To verify your domain later:
1. Go to: https://resend.com/domains
2. Add: `keykingslocksmithsc.com`
3. Add DNS records they provide
4. Then emails will send from `noreply@keykingslocksmithsc.com`
