This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring the custom domain `keykingslocksmithsc.com` with Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Domain name `keykingslocksmithsc.com` is registered
- [ ] You have access to the domain registrar account
- [ ] Vercel project is created and ready for deployment

## Overview

You'll be configuring:
- **Primary domain**: `keykingslocksmithsc.com` (root domain)
- **WWW subdomain**: `www.keykingslocksmithsc.com` (optional but recommended)
- **SSL/TLS certificate**: Automatically provisioned by Vercel (Let's Encrypt)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Add Domain to Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account: https://vercel.com
2. Navigate to your Key Kings Locksmith project
3. Click on **Settings** in the top navigation
4. Click on **Domains** in the left sidebar
5. In the "Add Domain" field, enter: `keykingslocksmithsc.com`
6. Click **Add**

Vercel will check if the domain is available and provide configuration instructions.

### Step 2: Add WWW Subdomain (Recommended)

After adding the root domain:

1. In the same Domains section, click **Add** again
2. Enter: `www.keykingslocksmithsc.com`
3. Click **Add**

**Why add www?**
- Provides flexibility for users who type "www"
- Vercel will automatically redirect www to non-www (or vice versa)
- Better for SEO and user experience

- May need to migrate other DNS records (email, etc.)

**When to use:**
- If you don't have other services using this domain
- If you want the simplest setup
- If you're comfortable with Vercel managing DNS

#### Method B: Custom DNS Records (A Record + CNAME)

**Pros:**
- Keep your current DNS provider
- Maintain control over all DNS records
- Good if you have email or other services on the domain

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex setup
- Need to manually configure records
- May take longer for DNS propagation

**When to use:**
- If you have email hosted on this domain
- If you have other services (subdomains) on this domain
- If you prefer to keep DNS with your registrar

4. Save the record

### Step 2: Add CNAME Record for WWW Subdomain

1. In the same DNS Management area
2. Add a new **CNAME Record**:
   - **Type**: CNAME
   - **Name**: `www`
   - **Value/Points to**: `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - **TTL**: `3600` (or 1 hour, or automatic)
3. Save the record

### Step 3: Verify DNS Records

Use a DNS lookup tool to verify your records are set correctly:

```bash
# Check A record (root domain)
dig keykingslocksmithsc.com A

# Expected result: 76.76.21.21

# Check CNAME record (www subdomain)
dig www.keykingslocksmithsc.com CNAME

# Expected result: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

Or use online tools:
- https://dnschecker.org
- https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx

### Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation

1. DNS changes typically take **1-4 hours**
2. Can take up to **48 hours** in rare cases
3. Check status at https://dnschecker.org

### Step 5: Verify in Vercel

1. Return to Vercel ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Vercel will detect the DNS records
3. SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned
4. Domain status will change to "Active" with green checkmark ‚úì

## SSL Certificate Configuration

Vercel automatically provisions and manages SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.

### What Happens Automatically

1. **Certificate Provisioning**: Vercel requests an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
2. **Domain Validation**: Vercel validates domain ownership via DNS
3. **Certificate Installation**: Certificate is installed and activated
4. **Auto-Renewal**: Certificates are automatically renewed before expiration

### Verify SSL Certificate

Once the domain is active:

1. Visit: `https://keykingslocksmithsc.com`
2. Check for the padlock icon üîí in the browser address bar
3. Click the padlock to view certificate details
4. Verify:
   - Certificate is issued by "Let's Encrypt"
   - Certificate is valid (not expired)
   - Domain name matches

### Test SSL Configuration

Use SSL testing tools:

1. **SSL Labs**: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
   - Enter: `keykingslocksmithsc.com`
   - Target grade: A or A+

2. **SSL Checker**: https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html
   - Verify certificate is properly installed
   - Check for any warnings

## Domain Redirect Configuration

### Configure WWW Redirect

Decide which version should be primary:

**Option 1: Non-WWW as Primary (Recommended)**
- Primary: `keykingslocksmithsc.com`
- Redirect: `www.keykingslocksmithsc.com` ‚Üí `keykingslocksmithsc.com`

**Option 2: WWW as Primary**
- Primary: `www.keykingslocksmithsc.com`
- Redirect: `keykingslocksmithsc.com` ‚Üí `www.keykingslocksmithsc.com`

### Set Primary Domain in Vercel

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Find the domain you want as primary
3. Click the three dots menu (‚ãØ)
4. Select **Set as Primary Domain**
5. Vercel will automatically redirect the other version

**Recommendation**: Use non-WWW (`keykingslocksmithsc.com`) as primary for cleaner URLs.

## Update Environment Variables

After domain is configured and active:

### Update SITE_URL for Production

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
2. Find `SITE_URL` variable
3. Update the value for **Production** environment:
   - Old: `https://your-preview-url.vercel.app`
   - New: `https://keykingslocksmithsc.com`
4. Save changes
5. **Redeploy** the site for changes to take effect

### Update Other Domain-Specific Variables

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Domain Shows "Pending" in Vercel

**Possible Causes:**
- DNS records not configured correctly
- DNS propagation not complete
- Nameservers not updated at registrar

**Solutions:**
1. Verify DNS records are correct
2. Check DNS propagation at dnschecker.org
3. Wait longer (up to 48 hours)
4. Clear your local DNS cache:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
   
   # Windows
   ipconfig /flushdns
   
   # Linux
   sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
   ```

### Issue: SSL Certificate Not Provisioning

**Possible Causes:**
- DNS not pointing to Vercel
- Domain validation failed
- CAA records blocking Let's Encrypt

**Solutions:**
1. Verify DNS is correctly configured
2. Check for CAA records that might block Let's Encrypt:
   ```bash
   dig keykingslocksmithsc.com CAA
   ```
3. If CAA records exist, add Let's Encrypt:
   ```
   0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
   ```
4. Remove and re-add domain in Vercel
5. Contact Vercel support if issue persists

### Issue: "Too Many Redirects" Error

**Possible Causes:**
- Redirect loop between www and non-www
- Conflicting redirect rules
- CDN or proxy configuration issue

**Solutions:**
1. Check which domain is set as primary in Vercel
2. Verify only one redirect rule exists
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Test in incognito/private browsing mode
5. Check for conflicting rules in vercel.json

### Issue: Mixed Content Warnings

**Possible Causes:**
- HTTP resources loaded on HTTPS page
- Hardcoded HTTP URLs in code
- External resources not using HTTPS

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for specific resources
2. Update all URLs to use HTTPS or protocol-relative URLs
3. Ensure all external resources support HTTPS
4. Update environment variables to use HTTPS

### Issue: Domain Works But WWW Doesn't (or vice versa)

**Possible Causes:**
- Only one domain added to Vercel
- DNS record missing for www subdomain
- Redirect not configured

**Solutions:**
1. Add both domains in Vercel (root and www)
2. Verify CNAME record exists for www subdomain
3. Set one as primary domain in Vercel
4. Test both URLs after DNS propagation
