Some insurance policies cover locksmith services, especially for emergency lockouts or after a break-in. Check your homeowners, renters, or auto insurance policy, or call your insurance company to ask about locksmith coverage. If your insurance covers the service, we can provide you with a detailed receipt and any documentation you need to file a claim.
