There are several telltale signs that your key fob battery is running low. The most common symptom is reduced range - you'll notice you need to be much closer to your vehicle for the buttons to work. You might also experience intermittent operation, where the fob works sometimes but not others, or you may need to press the buttons multiple times to get a response.

Many modern vehicles display a warning message on the dashboard when the key fob battery is low. Some cars may also require you to hold the fob very close to the start button, or you might notice the keyless entry system becoming less responsive. If your fob has an LED light that blinks when you press buttons, a dim or non-existent light can indicate a dying battery.

While replacing a key fob battery is often a simple DIY task, some key fobs require special tools or procedures to open without breaking the housing. If you're unsure or don't want to risk damaging your expensive key fob, we can replace the battery for you quickly and ensure everything is working properly. We carry batteries for most common key fob models and can handle the replacement on-site.
