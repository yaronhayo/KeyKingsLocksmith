Yes, a peephole (or door viewer) is an inexpensive but important security feature for any exterior door. It allows you to see who's at your door before opening it, helping you avoid opening the door to strangers, potential threats, or during a home invasion attempt. Standard peepholes provide a wide-angle view of your doorstep and work well for most situations. For better visibility, consider a digital door viewer with a screen on the inside or a video doorbell system.

Proper installation is important for a peephole to be effective. It should be installed at a height comfortable for all household members to use. The viewing angle should cover your entire front step and approach area. For doors with glass panels or sidelights, peepholes are less critical but still useful for quick identification. We can install traditional peepholes, wide-angle viewers, or modern video doorbell systems that let you see and speak with visitors from anywhere using your smartphone. Never rely solely on a peephole - use it in combination with quality locks, a strong door, and common sense about when to open your door.
