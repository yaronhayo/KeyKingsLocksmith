Sliding glass doors are common entry points for burglars because the standard locks are often weak. The most effective security improvement is installing a secondary locking mechanism. We recommend a pin lock or key-operated lock installed at the top of the door, which prevents the door from being lifted off its track - a common bypass technique. A Charlie bar or security bar in the bottom track adds another layer of protection.

For comprehensive security, consider upgrading to a modern sliding door lock with a hook-style latch that's much harder to force than standard latches. Anti-lift devices prevent the door from being removed from its tracks. You can also add a glass break sensor if you have a security system. We can assess your sliding door and recommend the best combination of locks and security devices. Regular maintenance is also important - make sure the door slides smoothly and the lock engages properly every time.
