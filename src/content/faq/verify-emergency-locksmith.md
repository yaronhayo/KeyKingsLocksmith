Great question - verification is important for your safety and security. When our technician arrives, they will be driving a vehicle with Key Kings Locksmith identification, wearing company apparel or displaying company ID, and they'll be able to confirm details from your service call. Don't hesitate to ask to see identification before allowing anyone to work on your locks - our professionals expect this and will gladly provide it.

Before the technician arrives, we'll typically provide you with their name and may offer a description of their vehicle. When they're close to your location, our technician will usually call you to confirm they're approaching and to verify your exact location. If anyone arrives claiming to be from our company but cannot provide proper identification or if details don't match what we told you on the phone, call us immediately at (864) 900-9597 to confirm.

You can also verify our business information before service - check our website, look up our registered business address in Anderson, SC, and read reviews from other customers. Our phone number, (864) 900-9597, connects directly to our local dispatch, not a call center or answering service in another state. We're transparent about who we are and where we're located because we're a legitimate local business serving our community. Trust your instincts - if something doesn't feel right, verify before allowing service to begin.
