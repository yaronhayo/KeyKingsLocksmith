Chain locks (also called door chains or security chains) provide limited security but serve an important purpose when used correctly. They allow you to partially open your door to speak with someone while maintaining a physical barrier. However, most chain locks can be defeated with moderate force - they're not strong enough to stop a determined intruder. Think of them as a communication tool rather than a primary security device.

For better security, consider a door security bar or swing bar lock, which mounts more securely and provides greater resistance to forced entry. If you want the convenience of partially opening your door, look for heavy-duty security chains or, better yet, a security door or screen door that lets you interact with visitors safely. When installing chain locks, ensure they're mounted into solid wood or studs, not just the door trim. Use the longest screws possible and choose chains made of hardened steel. We can install proper security chains and recommend more robust options like security bars. Remember, your main protection comes from quality deadbolts and a strong door - chain locks are just an additional layer for specific situations.
