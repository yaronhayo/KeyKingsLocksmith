As a landlord, you should rekey your rental property every time a tenant moves out. This is essential for security and liability reasons. Former tenants may have made copies of keys for family members or friends, and keys can be lost or stolen. Rekeying between tenants ensures that only authorized individuals can access the property, protecting both your investment and your new tenants.

For long-term tenants, consider rekeying if there's been a security incident, a roommate moves out, or if keys are lost or stolen. Many professional property managers include rekeying as a standard part of their tenant turnover process. We offer discounted rates for property managers and landlords with multiple units. We can also set up master key systems that allow you to access all your rental units with a single key while giving each tenant a unique key for their specific unit.
