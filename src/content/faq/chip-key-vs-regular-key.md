A regular key is simply a metal blade cut to match your vehicle's lock cylinders. It can unlock your doors and fit in the ignition, but that's where its function ends. A chip key, also called a transponder key, looks like a regular key but contains an electronic microchip embedded in the plastic head. This chip must communicate with your car's immobilizer system for the engine to start.

With a regular key, anyone could make a copy at a hardware store and start your car. With a chip key, even a perfectly cut duplicate won't start your vehicle unless the chip is properly programmed to your car's security system. This added layer of protection has significantly reduced vehicle theft rates since chip keys became standard.

If you have a chip key and need a duplicate, a simple metal copy won't work - you'll need a locksmith or dealer who can both cut the key and program the chip. We specialize in chip key duplication and programming for all major vehicle makes and models. We can create fully functional chip keys on-site, saving you the time and expense of a dealership visit.
