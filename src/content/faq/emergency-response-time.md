Our average emergency response time in Anderson and the surrounding Upstate SC area is 20-30 minutes, though this can vary based on your exact location and current traffic conditions. When you call (864) 900-9597, we immediately dispatch the nearest available technician to your location and provide you with an estimated arrival time.

We understand that being locked out is stressful, which is why we prioritize emergency calls and keep you informed throughout the process. Our technician will call you en route to confirm your location and let you know when they're getting close. For customers in more remote areas of our service region, response times may be slightly longer, but we'll always give you an honest estimate when you call.

During our business hours (Sunday-Thursday 7am-10pm, Friday 6:30am-5:30pm), we maintain multiple service vehicles strategically positioned throughout the Upstate to ensure the fastest possible response. Stay in a safe location while waiting, and don't hesitate to call us with any questions or updates about your situation.
