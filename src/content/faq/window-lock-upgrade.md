Yes, window locks are an important but often overlooked aspect of home security. Many burglars enter through windows rather than doors, especially ground-floor and easily accessible windows. Standard window latches on older homes are often flimsy and easy to bypass. Upgrading to keyed window locks or pin-style locks significantly improves security and takes just minutes per window.

Different window types require different locks. Double-hung windows work well with sash locks or pin locks that prevent the window from opening. Sliding windows benefit from track locks or wedge locks. Casement windows should have multi-point locking systems. For basement or ground-floor windows, consider adding window security bars or guards that allow ventilation but prevent entry. We can evaluate your windows and recommend appropriate locks based on your window types, security needs, and budget. Proper window security, combined with good door locks, creates a comprehensive home security system.
