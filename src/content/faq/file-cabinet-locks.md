Yes, we service file cabinet locks for businesses and home offices. Whether you've lost the key, the lock is jammed, or you need to rekey multiple cabinets to work with one key, we can help. We can pick open locked file cabinets without damaging them, create new keys, replace broken locks, or rekey existing locks. For businesses with many file cabinets, we can set them up on a master key system so one key opens all cabinets, or create different access levels for different employees.
