Reduced key fob range is almost always an indicator that the battery is getting weak. As the battery voltage drops, the transmitter in your key fob can't send signals as far, requiring you to be much closer to your vehicle for the buttons to work. This is often one of the first signs that your battery needs replacement, appearing weeks or even months before the fob stops working entirely.

Other factors that can affect key fob range include radio frequency interference from other electronic devices, cell phone towers, or even other key fobs in your pocket or purse. Physical damage to the fob's antenna or circuit board can also reduce signal strength. Environmental conditions like being in underground parking structures with thick concrete walls or areas with significant electromagnetic interference can temporarily reduce your fob's effective range.

If replacing the battery doesn't restore your key fob's normal range, there may be a more serious issue with the fob's internal components or your vehicle's receiver system. We can test your key fob's signal strength, replace the battery if needed, and diagnose whether the problem is with the fob itself or your car's receiver. Our service includes testing the vehicle's antennas and receiver module to ensure everything is working at optimal performance.
