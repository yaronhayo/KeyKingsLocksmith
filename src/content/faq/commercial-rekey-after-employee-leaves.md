Yes, rekeying your business locks when employees leave is a critical security practice, especially if the employee had unsupervised access, handled cash or inventory, left on bad terms, or failed to return all keys. Even trustworthy former employees can lose keys after they leave, or the keys could be stolen. Rekeying prevents unauthorized access and protects your business, employees, and assets from potential liability.

For businesses with high employee turnover or multiple locations, we recommend implementing a master key system or upgrading to electronic access control. These systems allow you to grant and revoke access instantly without physically rekeying locks. With electronic access control, you simply deactivate an employee's access card or code when they leave - no need to change locks or redistribute keys to remaining staff.

Key Kings Locksmith provides same-day commercial rekeying throughout Anderson and Upstate SC. We can rekey individual locks or your entire facility quickly and affordably. If you're tired of rekeying every time someone leaves, ask us about key control systems with restricted keyways or electronic access control solutions that make employee transitions easier and more secure.
