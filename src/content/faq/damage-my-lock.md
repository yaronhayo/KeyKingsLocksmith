No, we use professional tools and techniques designed to open locks without causing damage. Our technicians are trained to work carefully and efficiently. In rare cases where a lock is severely damaged or malfunctioning, we may need to drill it, but we'll always discuss this with you first and explain your options. We carry replacement locks on our service vehicles so we can install a new lock immediately if needed.
