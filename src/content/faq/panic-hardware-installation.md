Panic hardware (also called exit devices or crash bars) allows people to exit a building quickly by pushing a horizontal bar, without needing to turn a knob or handle. Building codes typically require panic hardware on exit doors in commercial buildings, especially in high-occupancy spaces like retail stores, offices, schools, and restaurants. The requirement ensures that people can evacuate safely during emergencies without fumbling with locks or keys.

There are several types of panic devices: rim devices (surface-mounted), mortise devices (integrated into the door), and vertical rod devices (for double doors or doors with top/bottom latching). Each type serves different door configurations and security needs. We help business owners choose compliant panic hardware that meets fire codes and ADA accessibility requirements while maintaining security when the building is closed.
