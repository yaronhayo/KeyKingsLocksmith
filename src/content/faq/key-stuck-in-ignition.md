A key stuck in the ignition is usually caused by the shifter not being fully in Park position (for automatic transmissions), a worn or damaged key, debris in the ignition cylinder, or a problem with the ignition lock cylinder itself. Before calling for help, make sure your vehicle is completely in Park and try gently wiggling the steering wheel while attempting to remove the key. Sometimes the steering lock mechanism needs to be in just the right position for the key to release.

Other common causes include a dead car battery (the electronic release mechanism needs power to function in many modern vehicles), a faulty ignition switch, or worn wafers inside the ignition cylinder that are binding on the key's ridges. Never force the key or use excessive pressure, as this can break the key off in the ignition or cause more serious damage to the ignition system.

If simple troubleshooting doesn't work, we can help extract your stuck key safely without damaging your ignition. Our technicians have specialized tools and techniques for removing stuck keys and can diagnose the underlying cause. We can also provide solutions to prevent the problem from recurring, whether that's replacing a worn key, cleaning the ignition cylinder, or installing a new ignition if necessary.
