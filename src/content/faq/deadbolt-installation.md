Yes, deadbolts are one of the most effective ways to improve your home security. A quality deadbolt is much harder to force open than a standard door knob lock. We recommend installing a Grade 1 deadbolt (the highest security rating) on all exterior doors. Look for deadbolts with at least a 1-inch throw (the part that extends into the door frame) and hardened steel construction. We can install new deadbolts, upgrade existing ones, or rekey your current deadbolts. For maximum security, consider a double-cylinder deadbolt for doors with glass panels nearby.
