Yes, we can create valet keys for most vehicles. A valet key is designed to start your car and unlock the driver's door, but it won't open the glove box or trunk, protecting your valuables when you hand your keys to parking attendants or service technicians. Many newer vehicles come with a valet key from the factory, but they're often lost or never provided if you bought your car used.

Creating a valet key requires cutting the key to match your door and ignition, and if your vehicle uses a transponder system, programming the chip with limited access permissions. Not all vehicle security systems support valet key functionality, so it's important to verify your specific make and model has this capability built into its computer system.

We can assess whether your vehicle supports valet keys and create one if possible. If your car doesn't have built-in valet key functionality, we can discuss alternative solutions to protect your valuables, such as installing a separate lock for your glove box or trunk. Contact us with your vehicle details, and we'll let you know what options are available.
