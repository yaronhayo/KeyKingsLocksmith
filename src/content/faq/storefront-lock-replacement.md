Storefront glass doors require specialized locks designed for aluminum-framed glass door systems. The most common types are storefront mortise locks with a hook-style latch that engages into the door frame, and rim-mounted panic devices for doors that require emergency exit hardware. These locks must withstand constant use, provide adequate security, and work reliably with the narrow aluminum frames typical of commercial glass doors.

When choosing locks for your storefront, consider your security needs, whether the door is an entrance or exit, local fire codes, and ADA accessibility requirements. High-quality commercial-grade locks from manufacturers like Adams Rite, Kawneer, and Von Duprin are designed specifically for aluminum storefront doors and provide better security and longevity than residential-grade hardware. Many business owners also add a floor-mounted drop bolt or flush bolt for additional security when the business is closed.
