A master key system allows you to control access throughout your business with different levels of keys. For example, you might have a master key that opens all doors, department keys that open specific areas, and individual keys for single rooms. This is perfect for businesses, apartment buildings, schools, or any facility where you need flexible access control. Employees can access only the areas they need, while managers or owners have master access. We design and install custom master key systems tailored to your specific security needs.
