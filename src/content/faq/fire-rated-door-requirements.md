Fire-rated doors are designed to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through a building for a specific period (typically 20, 45, 60, or 90 minutes). Building codes require fire-rated doors in stairwells, corridors, mechanical rooms, and between different occupancy types. Fire-rated doors must remain closed or have automatic closers that ensure they close and latch during a fire. All hardware on a fire-rated door - including locks, hinges, closers, and panic devices - must also be fire-rated and installed correctly. Using non-rated hardware or improper installation voids the fire rating.

Common fire door violations include propping doors open, removing or disabling door closers, installing non-rated locks or hardware, leaving gaps around the door frame, and removing or painting over fire rating labels. These violations create serious life safety hazards and can result in code enforcement actions, fines, increased insurance premiums, or liability if a fire occurs. Fire marshals regularly inspect commercial buildings and will issue violation notices for non-compliant fire doors.
