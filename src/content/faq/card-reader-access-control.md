Card reader access control offers significant advantages over traditional keys for most commercial properties. Employees use proximity cards, key fobs, or smartphone credentials to unlock doors - no fumbling with keys while carrying items or trying to unlock doors in the dark. You can grant or revoke access instantly from a computer, eliminating the need to collect keys from terminated employees or rekey locks. The system logs every entry, giving you a complete audit trail of who accessed which doors and when. You can also set time-based restrictions, allowing access only during work hours or specific days.

Modern access control systems range from simple stand-alone card readers on single doors to comprehensive network-connected systems managing hundreds of doors across multiple locations. Cloud-based systems allow you to manage access from anywhere using a web browser or smartphone app, receive instant alerts about security events, integrate with video surveillance and alarm systems, and automatically grant or revoke access based on HR data. Many systems also support multiple credential types: cards, key fobs, PIN codes, smartphone apps, and biometric readers.
