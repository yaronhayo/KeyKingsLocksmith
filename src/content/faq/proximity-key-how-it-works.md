A proximity key, also called a smart key or keyless entry fob, uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to communicate with your vehicle. The key constantly emits a low-frequency signal that your car can detect when you're within a certain range, typically 3-6 feet. When the car's sensors detect the authorized key nearby, it automatically unlocks the doors when you touch the handle, and allows you to start the engine by pressing a button without inserting a key.

The system uses encrypted rolling codes that change each time you use the key, making it extremely difficult for thieves to intercept and duplicate the signal. Your proximity key contains a small battery that powers the transmitter, and the car contains multiple antennas positioned around the vehicle to detect the key's presence and location. This is why the system knows whether the key is inside or outside the car.

If you lose your proximity key or need a spare, we can program new proximity keys for most vehicle makes and models. The replacement process requires specialized equipment to sync the new key with your vehicle's security system. We also service proximity keys that aren't working properly, which is often caused by a dead battery, signal interference, or the key needing to be re-synced with your vehicle.
