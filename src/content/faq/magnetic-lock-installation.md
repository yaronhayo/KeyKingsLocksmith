Magnetic locks (or maglocks) use electromagnetic force to secure doors. An electromagnet mounted on the door frame holds a steel plate attached to the door with hundreds of pounds of force when powered. They're popular in commercial buildings because they have no moving parts to wear out, work on doors of any size or weight, create no noise when opening, and integrate easily with access control systems. Magnetic locks are ideal for high-traffic areas, glass doors where traditional locks are difficult to install, and situations where you need remote door control.

However, magnetic locks must comply with fire and life safety codes. They require emergency release mechanisms so people can always exit the building during emergencies, even if power fails. This typically means installing a push button or motion sensor on the exit side, connecting them to fire alarm systems, and adding battery backup power. Some jurisdictions restrict where magnetic locks can be used or require delayed egress with audible alarms. Improper installation of magnetic locks can create serious safety hazards and code violations.
