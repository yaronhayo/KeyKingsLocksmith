Yes, we can create new car keys even if you've lost all of them. We can cut and program new keys for most vehicles using your VIN number and our specialized equipment. This includes traditional keys, transponder keys, key fobs, and proximity keys for push-button start systems. The process is more involved than duplicating an existing key, but we have the tools and expertise to get you back on the road. Call us with your vehicle information and we'll explain the process and provide a quote.
