First and most importantly, get yourself to a safe location. If you're locked out of your car, move to a safe distance from traffic and stay in a well-lit, populated area if possible. For home lockouts, wait in your vehicle if you have it, or with a neighbor or nearby business. Your safety while waiting is more important than monitoring the property. Keep your phone charged and accessible so our technician can contact you when they're approaching.

While waiting, gather any identification and proof of ownership you have available - driver's license, vehicle registration, utility bills, or other documents that verify your connection to the property or vehicle. This helps speed up the verification process when our technician arrives. Don't attempt DIY lockout solutions like credit cards, wire hangers, or improvised tools - these rarely work on modern locks and often cause damage that makes our job harder and more expensive.

If you have any relevant information about your locks - such as what brand they are, whether they're high-security models, or if you've had issues with them before - share this with our technician when they arrive. Stay near the location but don't block access to the lock. If weather is extreme, let us know if you need to wait somewhere more comfortable nearby and we'll call you just before arrival. Our average response time is 20-30 minutes in the Anderson area, so help is on the way soon. Call (864) 900-9597 if your situation changes or if you have questions while waiting.
