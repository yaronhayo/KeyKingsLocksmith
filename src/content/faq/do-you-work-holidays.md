Yes, we understand that lockouts and lock emergencies don't take holidays off. We provide emergency locksmith services on most major holidays including New Year's Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. However, our holiday hours may differ from our standard schedule, so we recommend calling (864) 900-9597 to confirm availability for your specific date.

During holidays, we may have reduced staffing or adjusted hours, but we make every effort to help customers facing emergency situations. Holiday service may include additional fees to compensate our technicians for working on these special days, which we'll always disclose upfront before dispatching a technician to your location.

If you're planning to travel during the holidays, it's a good idea to have our number saved in your phone as a precaution. We've helped countless families who found themselves locked out during holiday gatherings or while traveling to visit relatives in the Anderson and Upstate SC area.
