Delayed egress locks are specialized exit devices that delay the opening of a door for 15 or 30 seconds after someone pushes the exit bar, while sounding an alarm. During the delay, security personnel can respond to the exit attempt. These locks are used in high-security areas like hospital behavioral health units, memory care facilities, retail stores trying to prevent theft, schools, and data centers where you need to control who exits while still meeting fire code requirements for emergency egress. The delayed release prevents unauthorized exits while still allowing people to leave during genuine emergencies.

However, delayed egress locks are heavily regulated by fire and building codes. They can only be used in specific building types, must have audible alarms, require connection to fire alarm systems (which immediately releases the lock), need illuminated signage explaining the delay, and must have manual override options for fire department use. Many jurisdictions restrict or prohibit delayed egress in certain occupancies. Improper installation or use of delayed egress locks creates serious life safety hazards and code violations. You should never install delayed egress devices without consulting local fire officials and obtaining proper permits.
