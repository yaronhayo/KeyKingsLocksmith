A transponder key is a car key with an electronic chip embedded inside the plastic head. This chip communicates with your vehicle's immobilizer system using radio frequency identification (RFID). When you insert the key and turn it, the car's computer sends a signal to the chip, which must respond with the correct code for the engine to start. This security feature prevents thieves from hot-wiring your car or using a simple metal copy of your key.

Most vehicles manufactured after 1995 use transponder keys as a standard anti-theft measure. If you try to start your car with a non-programmed key, even if it physically fits and turns in the ignition, the engine won't start. The transponder chip must be programmed to match your specific vehicle's computer system.
