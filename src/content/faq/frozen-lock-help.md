Frozen car locks are a common winter emergency in South Carolina during those rare cold snaps. Before calling for emergency service, try these quick remedies: use a lock de-icer spray (available at auto parts stores), carefully warm your key with a lighter or match and gently insert it to melt the ice, or apply hand sanitizer to the key and work it into the lock (the alcohol content helps melt ice). Never pour hot water on a frozen lock - the rapid temperature change can damage components and the water may refreeze worse than before.

If these methods don't work, or if you're dealing with multiple frozen locks, call us at (864) 900-9597 for assistance. Our technicians have professional de-icing tools and techniques to safely thaw frozen locks without causing damage. We can also access your vehicle through other entry points if necessary and get you on your way quickly.

To prevent frozen locks in the future, we recommend treating your locks with a silicone-based lubricant before winter weather arrives, parking in covered areas when possible, and covering your locks with tape or magnetic covers during ice storms. Many newer vehicles with electronic locks are less susceptible to freezing, but mechanical locks remain vulnerable. Our team can also install heated lock systems or recommend modern electronic entry upgrades that eliminate this winter frustration altogether.
