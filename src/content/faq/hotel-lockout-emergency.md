For hotel room lockouts, your first call should always be to the hotel's front desk or security team, not an independent locksmith. Hotels have master keys and electronic key-making systems specifically for their properties, and they can provide replacement room keys quickly and at no charge. They're also legally responsible for access to their rooms and typically won't allow outside locksmiths to work on their locks without authorization.

Hotel policy typically requires that only their authorized staff access guest room locks for security and liability reasons. Calling an outside locksmith for a hotel room could result in you being charged for the service call even though we cannot help without hotel authorization. Hotels also have security protocols to verify guest identity before providing access, which protects all guests.

However, if you're locked out of your personal vehicle in the hotel parking lot, or if you're staying in a rental property, vacation home, or Airbnb in the Anderson area, that's where we can help. Call us at (864) 900-9597 for car lockouts, residential property lockouts, or any situation where you need locksmith services at your temporary accommodation. We've helped many travelers with vehicle lockouts at local hotels and can usually arrive within 20-30 minutes to get you back on your way.
