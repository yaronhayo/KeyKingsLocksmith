The right commercial safe depends on what you're protecting and the threats you face. Cash businesses need drop safes or deposit safes that allow employees to secure money throughout the day without safe access. Document storage requires fire-rated safes that protect paper from heat damage. Gun safes and pharmacy safes must meet specific regulatory requirements. High-value inventory or data storage needs burglary-rated safes with stronger construction and better locks. Consider both fire protection (rated by time and temperature) and burglary protection (rated by forced entry resistance) when choosing a safe.

Size matters for commercial safes - most businesses underestimate their storage needs and buy safes that are too small. Safes should be large enough for your current needs plus room for growth, but small enough to fit through doorways and position where you need them. Location is also important: safes should be secured to the floor or wall in areas with limited visibility from outside, away from water sources and excessive heat, and accessible to authorized personnel. Professional installation ensures proper anchoring and positioning.
