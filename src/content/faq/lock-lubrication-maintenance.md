Regular lock maintenance prevents common problems like sticky locks, keys that won't turn, or locks that jam. The most important maintenance task is proper lubrication. Use graphite powder or a specialized lock lubricant - never use WD-40 or oil-based products, as these attract dust and dirt that will gum up the lock mechanism over time. Apply lubricant once or twice a year, or whenever you notice the key becoming harder to turn.

Keep your locks clean by periodically wiping the exterior with a damp cloth. If you notice your key is difficult to insert or turn, don't force it - this can break the key inside the lock. Check that your deadbolt extends fully and retracts smoothly. Tighten any loose screws on the lock or strike plate. For exterior locks exposed to weather, inspect them seasonally for rust or corrosion. If a lock is consistently stiff or doesn't work properly despite lubrication, it may need professional service or replacement. We offer maintenance services and can identify potential problems before they leave you locked out.
