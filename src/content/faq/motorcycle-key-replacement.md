Yes, we provide complete key services for motorcycles, including key cutting, transponder programming, and ignition repair or replacement. Motorcycle keys have evolved significantly over the years, from simple metal keys to sophisticated transponder keys and proximity systems similar to those found in modern cars. We work with all types of motorcycle keys for major brands including Harley-Davidson, Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Ducati, BMW, and more.

Motorcycle key replacement can be more complex than car keys because many bikes have additional locks for the gas cap, seat, and storage compartments that may use the same key. We can create master keys that work for all your motorcycle's locks, or separate keys if needed. For motorcycles with immobilizer systems and transponder keys, we have the specialized equipment to program new keys to your bike's security system without requiring an expensive trip to the dealer.

Our mobile service is particularly valuable for motorcycle key services - we come to wherever your bike is located, whether that's your home, workplace, or on the side of the road. We can make keys on-site even if you've lost all your originals, using the lock cylinders or VIN number to create properly cut keys. For vintage or rare motorcycles with unique key profiles, we can often source or fabricate the correct blank and create functional replacement keys.
