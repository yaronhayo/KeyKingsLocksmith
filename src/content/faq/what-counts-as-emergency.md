A locksmith emergency is any situation where you're unable to access your property or vehicle when you urgently need to, or when your security has been compromised. Common emergencies include being locked out of your home with no other way in, locked keys in a running car, being unable to access your business when you need to open for customers, having a child or pet locked inside a vehicle, or discovering a broken or vandalized lock that leaves your property unsecured.

Emergency situations also include broken keys stuck in locks, malfunctioning locks that won't open from either side, locks damaged during a break-in attempt, and security concerns requiring immediate lock changes. Basically, if the situation is causing significant inconvenience, poses a safety risk, or compromises your security, it qualifies as an emergency that warrants immediate locksmith assistance.

Non-emergency requests - like wanting to rekey your locks at your convenience, adding a deadbolt to increase security, or getting spare keys made - can typically be scheduled during regular business hours without the urgency factor.
