While hardware stores and kiosks offer quick key copying, professional locksmiths provide more accurate duplicates, especially for high-security keys, car keys, or keys with complex patterns. Poorly cut keys from automated machines can damage your locks over time or fail to work when you need them most. Professional locksmiths use precision equipment and quality key blanks, and we can verify that each duplicate works properly before you leave.

For standard house keys, we can make copies while you wait. However, high-security keys with patent-protected keyways, restricted keys, or keys marked "Do Not Duplicate" require proper authorization and can only be copied by authorized dealers. If you need car keys with transponder chips or key fobs, professional programming is required - hardware stores can't duplicate these. We keep a large inventory of key blanks and can handle virtually any key type. We also maintain records of your keys, making future duplicates easier. When making spare keys, think about who really needs them and number each key to track distribution.
