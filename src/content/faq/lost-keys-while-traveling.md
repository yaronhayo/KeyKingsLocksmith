Absolutely! We regularly help travelers who've lost their keys while passing through Anderson and the Upstate SC region. Whether you've lost car keys, hotel room keys, or keys to your travel trailer or RV, call us at (864) 900-9597 and we'll do our best to get you back on the road quickly. For vehicles, we can make new keys for most makes and models, including programming transponder keys and key fobs on-site.

When you call, let us know you're traveling through and provide as much information as possible - your vehicle's year, make, and model, your VIN number (located on the driver's side dashboard visible through the windshield), and your location. We may need to verify ownership, so have your driver's license and vehicle registration ready. For newer vehicles with advanced security systems, key programming may take longer but we carry diagnostic equipment for most common vehicle brands.

If you're staying at a local hotel and need access to your room, we recommend first contacting hotel security or the front desk - they usually can provide replacement room keys quickly at no charge. For RVs, trailers, or other travel-related lockouts, we have extensive experience with these unique locking systems. While being stranded away from home is stressful, we're here to help get you back on your journey as quickly as possible.
