Access control systems let you manage who can enter your building or specific areas electronically. Instead of traditional keys, employees use key cards, fobs, PIN codes, or biometric scanners (fingerprint or facial recognition). You can grant or revoke access instantly, track who enters and when, and set time-based restrictions (like allowing access only during business hours). This is ideal for businesses, apartment buildings, gyms, or any facility where you need to control and monitor access. We design, install, and maintain access control systems tailored to your security needs and budget.
