Rekeying is usually the best option if your locks are in good condition but you need new keys. This is common after moving into a new home, losing keys, or after a break-in. Rekeying changes the internal pins so old keys no longer work, but you keep the same lock hardware.

Replace your locks if they're damaged, outdated, or you want to upgrade to better security features like smart locks or high-security deadbolts. We'll assess your situation and recommend the most cost-effective solution for your needs.
