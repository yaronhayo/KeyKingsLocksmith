Commercial door closers automatically return doors to the closed and latched position after someone opens them. Building and fire codes require door closers on fire-rated doors, stairwell doors, and many exterior doors in commercial buildings. They prevent fire and smoke from spreading through a building, maintain climate control, improve security by ensuring doors don't stay propped open, and reduce wear on door hardware by controlling how doors close.

A properly adjusted door closer closes the door smoothly and completely without slamming. Over time, door closers can leak hydraulic fluid, lose adjustment, or fail completely - leading to doors that slam shut, close too slowly, or don't latch properly. This creates safety hazards, code violations, and security vulnerabilities. Regular maintenance and timely replacement of worn door closers is essential for any commercial property.
