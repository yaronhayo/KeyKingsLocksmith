Yes, we can make keys without the original in most cases. For house locks, we can create a new key by decoding the lock cylinder. For car keys, we can cut keys by VIN number or by decoding the ignition or door lock. Modern car keys with chips or fobs require programming, which we also handle. The process varies by lock type and vehicle, but we have the tools and expertise to create keys even when you don't have the original.
