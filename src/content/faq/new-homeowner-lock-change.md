Absolutely, yes. Changing or rekeying locks should be one of the first things you do when moving into a new home. You never know how many copies of the keys exist - previous owners, their family members, friends, contractors, real estate agents, and even former tenants may have copies. Even if the previous owners seem trustworthy, keys can be lost or fall into the wrong hands.

Rekeying is usually the most cost-effective option if your existing locks are in good condition. This process changes the internal pins so old keys no longer work, while keeping your existing hardware. However, if the locks are old, damaged, or low-quality, we recommend replacing them entirely with high-security locks. This is also an excellent opportunity to upgrade to smart locks or ensure all exterior doors have deadbolts. We can assess your new home's security and recommend the best solution for your budget and needs.
