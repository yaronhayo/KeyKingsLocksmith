Yes, keys locked in a running vehicle create multiple urgent concerns beyond a standard lockout. This situation poses security risks (someone could drive away with your car), environmental concerns (wasted fuel and emissions), and potential safety hazards depending on where the vehicle is running. Call us immediately at (864) 900-9597 and inform us that your keys are locked in a running vehicle - we'll treat this as a priority emergency.

While waiting for our technician to arrive, stay with your vehicle at all times if it's safe to do so. Don't leave a running car unattended, even for a few minutes. If your vehicle is in a dangerous location like an active roadway or if you feel unsafe, call local police for assistance as well. In cold weather, there's less urgency than in summer heat, but it's still important to resolve the situation quickly.

Our technicians are equipped to unlock running vehicles quickly and safely using professional tools that won't damage your car's locking mechanism. Once we have you back in your vehicle, we can also make a spare key on the spot to prevent this situation from happening again. Many newer vehicles have safety features that prevent locking keys inside while running, but older models are more susceptible to this frustrating scenario.
