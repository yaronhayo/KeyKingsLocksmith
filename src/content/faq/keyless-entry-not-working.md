Keyless entry problems can stem from several causes, with a dead key fob battery being the most common culprit. If the battery is low or dead, your key fob won't have enough power to send signals to your vehicle. Other frequent causes include the key fob losing its programming connection with your car, physical damage to the fob's internal components, or interference from other electronic devices or metal objects near the key.

Sometimes the issue isn't with the key fob at all, but with your vehicle's receiver system. Blown fuses, damaged door lock actuators, or problems with the car's central locking module can prevent the keyless entry from functioning even when your key fob is working perfectly. Environmental factors like extreme cold can also temporarily affect the range and reliability of your keyless entry system.

We can diagnose exactly why your keyless entry isn't working and provide the appropriate solution. This might be as simple as replacing the battery and reprogramming the fob, or it could require more in-depth troubleshooting of your vehicle's electronic systems. Our mobile service means we come to you, test the system on-site, and get your keyless entry working again without requiring a trip to the dealership.
