Yes, we replace mailbox locks for residential mailboxes, apartment mailboxes, and commercial mail centers. If you've lost your mailbox key or the lock is damaged, we can install a new lock cylinder. For USPS-regulated mailboxes (like apartment cluster boxes), we follow postal service requirements and can coordinate with your local post office if needed. We carry common mailbox lock sizes and can usually complete the replacement quickly. Protecting your mail from theft is important, so don't delay if your mailbox lock is broken or you've lost the key.
