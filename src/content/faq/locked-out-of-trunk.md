Yes, we can help you regain access to your locked trunk. Trunk lockouts happen for various reasons - broken or lost trunk keys, a malfunctioning trunk latch, dead car battery preventing electronic trunk release, or accidentally closed trunk lid with keys inside. Our technicians have specialized tools and techniques to safely open your trunk without damaging the paint, lock mechanism, or surrounding components.

The method we use depends on your vehicle type and the specific cause of the lockout. For sedans with rear seats that fold down, we might access the trunk through the interior if we can get into the passenger compartment. For trunks with external lock cylinders, we can pick or decode the lock, or in some cases remove the lock cylinder to operate the latch mechanism directly. Modern vehicles with electronic trunk releases may require accessing the car's interior first to either charge the battery or manually activate the trunk release mechanism.

Once we've opened your trunk, we can address the root cause to prevent future lockouts. This might include making a new trunk key, repairing or replacing a faulty trunk latch or lock cylinder, or fixing issues with the electronic release system. We provide comprehensive trunk lockout and repair services for all vehicle makes and models, ensuring you regain access quickly and your trunk functions properly going forward.
