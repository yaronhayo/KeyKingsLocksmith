If a child or pet is locked in your vehicle, this is a critical emergency. First, assess the situation immediately - if the child or pet is in distress, showing signs of heat exhaustion, or if the weather is hot, call 911 right away. Emergency responders are authorized to break windows if necessary to save a life, and your child or pet's safety is always the top priority over vehicle damage concerns.

While waiting, stay visible to the child or pet to keep them calm, try to keep them engaged and reassured through the window, and monitor them continuously for any signs of distress.
