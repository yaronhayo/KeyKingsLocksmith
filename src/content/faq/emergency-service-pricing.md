Emergency locksmith services are priced fairly based on the urgency and timing of your call. During our standard business hours (Sunday-Thursday 7am-10pm, Friday 6:30am-5:30pm), emergency lockouts are charged at our regular service rates with no additional premium. However, calls requiring immediate response during peak hours or in challenging conditions may involve priority service fees.

We believe in transparent, honest pricing with no hidden surprises. When you call (864) 900-9597, we'll provide a clear estimate before dispatching a technician, including any applicable service call fees and the estimated cost for your specific situation. The final price depends on factors like your lock type, the complexity of the job, and whether any parts need to be replaced.

Unlike some companies that significantly inflate prices during emergencies, we charge fair rates that reflect the actual work involved. We'll never take advantage of your stressful situation. If additional work is needed beyond the initial estimate - such as lock replacement if we can't open it non-destructively - we'll always get your approval before proceeding with any extra charges.
