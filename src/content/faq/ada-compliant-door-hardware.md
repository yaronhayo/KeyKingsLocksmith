The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) sets standards for door hardware to ensure people with disabilities can access commercial buildings. ADA-compliant hardware must be operable with one hand without tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist. This typically means lever handles instead of round knobs, push/pull plates, or panic hardware with push bars. Door handles must be mounted at specific heights (between 34-48 inches from the floor), and doors must require no more than 5 pounds of force to operate.

ADA compliance isn't optional for most commercial buildings - it's federal law. Non-compliant hardware can result in lawsuits, fines, and forced renovations. Beyond legal requirements, accessible hardware benefits everyone: it's easier for people carrying items, parents with strollers, elderly customers, and delivery personnel. Making your business accessible is both the right thing to do and good for business.
