A restricted keyway is a patented key profile that can only be duplicated by authorized dealers with written authorization from the key system owner. Unlike standard keys that can be copied at any hardware store or key kiosk, restricted keyway systems give you complete control over who can make copies of your keys. This prevents employees from making unauthorized duplicates, ensures terminated employees can't copy keys before returning them, and eliminates the security risk of "lost" keys being duplicated without your knowledge.

Restricted keyway systems are essential for businesses that need strict key control: medical offices with patient privacy concerns, law firms with confidential files, property management companies with master key systems, retail stores with high employee turnover, or any business where unauthorized key duplication could create serious security or liability issues. These systems include detailed documentation of who has which keys and a complete audit trail of all key duplications.
