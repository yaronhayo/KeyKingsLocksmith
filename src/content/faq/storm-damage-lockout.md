Yes, storm-damaged locks are serious security emergencies that we address as quickly and safely as possible. If severe weather has damaged your locks, leaving your property unsecured, call us at (864) 900-9597 immediately. We'll assess the weather conditions and dispatch a technician as soon as it's safe to travel. Your security is important, but your safety and our technician's safety during active severe weather is paramount.

During or immediately after major storms, response times may be longer than usual due to road conditions, downed trees, power outages, and high call volume from other storm-related emergencies. We prioritize calls based on security vulnerability and safety concerns - for example, a completely broken door that can't be secured takes priority over a damaged lock that can still be temporarily secured.

While waiting for our arrival, try to temporarily secure the damaged area as best you can - move valuable items away from the exposed area, use boards or heavy furniture to block access if necessary, and consider having a family member or neighbor stay with you if you feel unsafe. Once we arrive, we'll assess the damage, secure your property with temporary or permanent lock solutions, and help you document the damage for insurance purposes. We carry emergency hardware on our service vehicles to restore your security quickly.
