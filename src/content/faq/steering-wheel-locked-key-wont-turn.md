A locked steering wheel is a common security feature that engages when you remove the key from the ignition while the wheels are turned. The steering wheel lock mechanism creates pressure on the ignition cylinder, preventing the key from turning. This is actually your car's anti-theft system working as designed, not a malfunction, though it can be frustrating when you're in a hurry.

The solution is usually simple: while gently trying to turn the key in the ignition, wiggle the steering wheel left and right. You'll feel the wheel move slightly in one direction before it hits the lock. Apply light pressure in that direction while simultaneously turning the key, and the steering wheel should unlock, allowing the key to turn freely. Don't force the key - excessive force can break the key off in the ignition or damage the cylinder.

If the standard technique doesn't work, there may be a more serious problem with your ignition cylinder, the steering column lock mechanism, or your key may be worn and no longer engaging the pins correctly. In these cases, professional help is needed. We can diagnose the specific issue and provide solutions ranging from key replacement to ignition cylinder repair or replacement, all done at your location for your convenience.
