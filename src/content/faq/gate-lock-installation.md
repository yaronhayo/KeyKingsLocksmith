Yes, we install locks on all types of gates - wooden privacy fences, chain link gates, wrought iron gates, and commercial security gates. Gate locks require special consideration because gates move and may not align perfectly like doors do. We'll recommend the right lock type for your gate material and usage, whether that's a padlock and hasp, a gate latch with lock, or an electronic gate lock. For businesses or gated communities, we can install keypad entry systems or card readers for convenient access control.
