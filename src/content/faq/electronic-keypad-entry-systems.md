Electronic keypad entry systems are an excellent security solution for many office environments. They eliminate the need for physical keys that can be lost, copied, or stolen. Employees enter a PIN code to unlock doors, and you can assign unique codes to each person, allowing you to track who enters and when. You can change codes instantly if an employee leaves or if a code is compromised, without calling a locksmith to rekey locks. Many modern keypads also integrate with access control systems for centralized management of multiple doors.

However, keypad security depends on proper use and management. Common mistakes include using obvious codes (like 1234 or the street address), sharing codes between multiple employees, never changing codes, or installing keypads without backup mechanical locks. High-quality commercial-grade keypads have features like anti-tamper alarms, automatic lockouts after failed attempts, audit trails, and weatherproof construction. Some combine keypad entry with card readers or smartphone access for added convenience and security.
