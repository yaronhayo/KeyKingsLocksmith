Multiple simultaneous lock failures are unusual and could indicate several issues - attempted break-in, defective keys, or synchronized lock component failure due to age or environmental factors. This situation warrants prompt attention, especially if it's affecting your ability to secure your home. Call us at (864) 900-9597 to schedule emergency service, particularly if you cannot properly lock your doors.

If multiple locks failed suddenly at the same time, first check your keys - worn or damaged keys can affect multiple locks, especially if they're the same brand or style. Try different keys if you have spares. If keys aren't the issue, the locks themselves may need attention. Older homes with original locks sometimes experience synchronized failure because all locks aged at the same rate. Weather changes, particularly humidity fluctuations, can also cause multiple locks to behave differently at once.

From a security standpoint, if you cannot lock one or more exterior doors, treat this as an emergency requiring same-day service. Even if you can lock your doors but they're operating poorly, it's worth scheduling prompt service - malfunctioning locks can fail completely at the worst possible time. We can assess all affected locks, determine the root cause, and provide solutions ranging from simple lubrication and adjustment to full lock replacement. Often, rekeying all locks with fresh keys and components will restore proper operation throughout your home.
