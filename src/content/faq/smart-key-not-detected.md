The "Smart Key Not Detected" message means your vehicle's proximity sensors cannot detect the presence of an authorized key fob. The most common cause is a dead or dying battery in your smart key - even if the battery has enough power to unlock doors from a distance, it might not have sufficient charge for the close-range proximity detection system. Try holding your smart key directly against the start button, as most vehicles have a backup RFID reader in that location that works even with a very weak battery.

Other potential causes include the key fob being too far from the vehicle (possibly left in a purse or jacket in the back seat), interference from other electronic devices or metal objects, or the key losing its programming connection with your car's security system. Some vehicles are sensitive to having multiple smart keys nearby, which can cause confusion in the detection system. Environmental factors like extreme cold can also temporarily affect the key's signal strength.

If replacing the battery and repositioning the key don't resolve the issue, the smart key may need to be reprogrammed or replaced. We specialize in diagnosing and fixing smart key detection problems. Our technicians can determine whether the issue is with the key itself, the vehicle's antenna system, or the car's security module, and provide an appropriate solution to get you back on the road quickly.
