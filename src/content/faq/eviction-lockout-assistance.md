Lock changes related to evictions require careful legal compliance. We can absolutely help landlords rekey or replace locks, but only after you've completed the proper legal eviction process through the courts. In South Carolina, landlords cannot simply change locks to force a tenant out - this is considered illegal "self-help" eviction and can result in significant legal liability. You must have a court order and follow proper sheriff-supervised eviction procedures.

Once you have legal possession of your property following a completed eviction, call us at (864) 900-9597 to schedule prompt lock rekeying or replacement. We recommend changing all locks immediately after regaining possession to ensure the former tenant cannot return and to protect your property. We can provide master key systems if you manage multiple rental properties, making it easier to maintain access while ensuring each unit has unique tenant keys.

For landlords, we also offer scheduled lock changes between tenants as part of routine property maintenance. This is a best practice that protects new tenants and gives everyone peace of mind. We can establish a service agreement for multi-property landlords who need regular lock maintenance. Always consult with your attorney regarding proper eviction procedures before requesting lock changes - we're here to help with the locksmith work once you've handled the legal requirements properly.
