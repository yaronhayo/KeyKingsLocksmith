question: "How can I reinforce my door to prevent kick-ins?"

Even the best lock won't help if your door or door frame is weak. Most break-ins involve kicking in the door, which splits the frame around the strike plate. The most effective reinforcement is installing a heavy-duty strike plate that's at least 3-4 inches long with screws that penetrate deep into the wall studs (3-inch screws minimum). Door reinforcement kits that include strike plate reinforcement and frame strengtheners can dramatically increase your door's resistance to forced entry.

Consider installing a door security bar or brace that wedges against the door and floor, providing resistance against both kick-ins and prying. For hollow-core doors, replacement with a solid-core or metal door significantly improves security. Ensure your door hinges are properly secured - use non-removable hinge pins for outward-opening doors, and reinforce hinge screws with 3-inch screws into the studs. Door edge guards protect against prying with crowbars. We can assess your door and frame, identify weak points, and install appropriate reinforcements. A properly reinforced door with quality locks makes your home much harder to break into, often causing burglars to move on to easier targets.
