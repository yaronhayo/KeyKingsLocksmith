Push-button start problems often relate to the key fob not being detected by your vehicle. The most common cause is a dead or dying key fob battery, which prevents the car's system from recognizing that an authorized key is present. Even if your fob has enough power to unlock the doors, it might not have sufficient charge for the push-button start system to detect it. Try holding the fob directly against the start button - many vehicles have a backup reader in that location for when the battery is low.

Other potential causes include the brake pedal not being fully depressed (most cars require this for safety), a problem with the steering wheel lock mechanism, or the key fob losing its programming. In some cases, the issue is with the car's starter system, battery, or security system rather than the key itself. Dashboard warning lights or error messages can provide important clues about what's causing the problem.

We can diagnose push-button start issues and determine whether the problem is with your key fob, the vehicle's start button module, or another component of the system. Our technicians have the diagnostic tools and expertise to identify the exact cause and provide an effective solution, whether that's replacing the fob battery, reprogramming your key, or addressing issues with the vehicle's starting system.
