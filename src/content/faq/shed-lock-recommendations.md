Outdoor storage sheds require weather-resistant locks that can withstand the elements while providing strong security. We recommend heavy-duty padlocks with hardened steel shackles that resist cutting and bolt cutters. Look for locks with shrouded shackles that protect against prying. Disc locks and closed-shackle padlocks are particularly effective because they minimize exposed surfaces that thieves can attack.

For better security, install a hasp and staple system with concealed or rotating screws that can't be easily removed. Consider using a high-security padlock rated for outdoor use with features like pick resistance and key control. If your shed has significant value or contains expensive equipment, you might want to install a keyed deadbolt directly into the door instead of relying on a hasp and padlock. We can assess your shed's construction and recommend the most appropriate locking system. Regular maintenance is important for outdoor locks - apply graphite lubricant annually to prevent moisture damage and ensure smooth operation.
