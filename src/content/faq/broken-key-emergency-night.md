Whether a broken key situation can wait depends on which lock is affected and your security circumstances. If the key broke in your front door lock and you're currently locked outside your home with no alternative entry, this is an immediate emergency that shouldn't wait. Similarly, if the broken key is preventing you from locking your door properly, leaving your home vulnerable to intrusion, you should seek emergency assistance.

However, if you have alternative entry to your home and the broken key is in a secondary lock, or if the key broke in your car's door lock but you can access your vehicle through another door, this can typically wait until our business hours resume. You can call us at (864) 900-9597 during our operating times (Sunday-Thursday 7am-10pm, Friday 6:30am-5:30pm) for key extraction and replacement.

Important: Don't attempt to extract the broken key yourself using improvised tools like tweezers, pliers, or super glue - you'll likely push it deeper or damage the lock cylinder, making professional extraction more difficult and expensive. If you must wait until morning, avoid using that lock entirely and ensure you have secure alternative access to your property. We carry specialized extraction tools and can usually remove broken keys without damaging the lock mechanism.
