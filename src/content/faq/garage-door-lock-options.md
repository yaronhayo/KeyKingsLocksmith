Garage security is critical because garages often connect directly to your home and contain valuable items. If you have an automatic garage door opener, ensure it uses rolling code technology that prevents code grabbing by thieves. Always keep your remote control secure and never leave it visible in your car. Consider adding a manual deadbolt or slide bolt lock to your garage door for times when you're away for extended periods, which prevents the door from being opened even if someone bypasses the opener.

For side garage doors, install the same quality locks you'd use on your home's exterior doors - a Grade 1 deadbolt at minimum. If your garage has windows, use frosted film or curtains to prevent thieves from seeing what's inside. Smart garage door openers let you monitor and control your garage remotely, sending alerts if the door opens unexpectedly. We can install manual locks, upgrade your side door security, and recommend smart garage solutions. Don't forget to secure the door between your garage and house with a strong deadbolt, treating it like any exterior door.
