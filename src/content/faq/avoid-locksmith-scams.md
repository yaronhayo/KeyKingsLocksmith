Locksmith scams unfortunately target people during their most vulnerable moments. Protect yourself by only calling established local companies with verifiable addresses and phone numbers - not generic 1-800 numbers that could route anywhere. When you call (864) 900-9597, you're reaching Key Kings Locksmith, a real local business serving Anderson and Upstate SC. Legitimate locksmiths will provide clear pricing estimates over the phone, arrive in marked vehicles, and show proper identification and licensing.

Red flags to watch for include: drastically low advertised prices that skyrocket upon arrival, technicians who insist on drilling locks as the only solution, demands for cash-only payment, unwillingness to provide written estimates, unmarked vehicles, and inability to show proper licensing or business documentation. Scammers often use fake company names that sound similar to legitimate businesses and manipulate online search results to appear first.

Before you're in an emergency, save our number in your phone and verify our business information. Check reviews, confirm our physical location, and ensure you're calling the actual local company. During an emergency, never let stress rush you into accepting service from someone who raises concerns. Ask for identification, request itemized written estimates before work begins, and don't hesitate to refuse service if something feels wrong. Legitimate locksmiths like Key Kings want you to feel safe and confident in our services.
