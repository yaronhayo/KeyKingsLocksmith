Our standard business hours are Sunday through Thursday 7am-10pm and Friday 6:30am-5:30pm, with Saturday being our closed day. If you're locked out outside of these hours, we recommend calling (864) 900-9597 to leave a message, and we'll respond as soon as we open. For immediate assistance during late-night hours, you may need to contact a 24/7 emergency locksmith service.

We recognize that lockouts can happen at any time, and we're continually evaluating our service hours to better meet customer needs. During our operating hours, including evenings up to 10pm on most nights, we're fully staffed and ready to help with any emergency lockout situation you're facing.

To avoid late-night lockouts, we recommend having spare keys made and stored with a trusted neighbor or family member, using a lockbox for emergency access, or considering a smart lock system that can be opened via smartphone. Our team can help you implement any of these preventive solutions during a regular service call.
