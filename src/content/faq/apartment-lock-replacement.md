In most cases, you need written permission from your landlord or property management company before changing apartment locks. Your lease agreement typically specifies who is responsible for lock changes and maintenance. Some landlords allow tenants to upgrade locks for security reasons, while others handle all lock changes themselves to maintain master key systems.

If you're concerned about security, talk to your landlord first. They may be willing to rekey your locks or allow you to do so if you provide them with copies of the new keys. Some landlords will even pay for lock changes if you have a legitimate security concern. Never change apartment locks without permission, as this could violate your lease and result in fines or eviction. We work with both tenants and property managers to find solutions that improve security while respecting lease agreements and property requirements.
