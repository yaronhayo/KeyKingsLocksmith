We recommend having at least two working keys for your vehicle, with three being ideal for maximum convenience and security. Having spare keys prevents the stress and expense of emergency locksmith services or dealership visits if you lose your only key. If you share your vehicle with family members, each regular driver should have their own key for convenience and safety reasons.

The cost of making spare keys while you still have a working original is significantly less than replacing lost keys or extracting broken keys from locks. Modern car keys with transponder chips or proximity features are expensive to replace, sometimes costing hundreds of dollars if you've lost all keys and the dealership needs to reprogram your vehicle's security system. Having spares made proactively is a smart investment that saves money in the long run.

Consider keeping one spare key at home in a secure location and giving another to a trusted family member or friend who lives nearby. Never hide spare keys on or near your vehicle - thieves know all the common hiding spots. We can create high-quality duplicate keys for your vehicle, including programming any necessary transponder chips or key fobs, all at a fraction of dealership prices. Contact us to get spare keys made before you need them in an emergency.
