Yes, absolutely. After a break-in, you should rekey or replace all locks that may have been compromised. Even if the intruder didn't use a key, your locks may have been damaged during the break-in attempt. Rekeying ensures that any keys the intruder might have obtained won't work. This is also a good time to upgrade to high-security locks or add additional security measures like deadbolts, security cameras, or smart locks. We can assess your property's security and recommend improvements to help prevent future break-ins.
