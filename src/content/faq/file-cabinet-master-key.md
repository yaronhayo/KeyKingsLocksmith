Yes, we can create master key systems for file cabinets so individual employees have keys to their own cabinets while supervisors or office managers have a master key that opens all cabinets. This is useful for offices where multiple people have locking file cabinets but you need administrative access to all cabinets for records management, emergency access, or when employees are out. Most commercial file cabinets use standard lock types from manufacturers like HON, Steelcase, or Haworth that can be master keyed with proper planning.

However, file cabinet locks provide minimal security - they're designed more for privacy than protection. Standard file cabinet locks can be picked easily or bypassed with simple tools, and the thin metal cabinets can be pried open. If you're storing truly confidential information (medical records, financial data, legal documents), consider upgrading to high-security file cabinets with better locks, using a safe for the most sensitive documents, or implementing document encryption and access controls. For moderate security needs, file cabinet locks combined with building access control provide reasonable protection.
