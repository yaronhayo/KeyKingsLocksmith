Lock bumping is a technique where thieves use specially cut "bump keys" to quickly open standard pin-tumbler locks without picking them. It's a real security concern because it leaves no obvious signs of forced entry and works on most traditional locks. Bump-proof or bump-resistant locks use special pin designs, sidebar mechanisms, or rotating disc technology that prevents this attack method. High-security locks from brands like Medeco, Mul-T-Lock, and ASSA ABLOY incorporate bump-resistant features along with pick resistance and key control.

Whether you need bump-proof locks depends on your security requirements and risk assessment. If you live in an area with property crime, have valuable items, or want maximum security, upgrading to bump-resistant locks is worthwhile. For most homeowners, Grade 1 locks with security pins provide good protection against common break-in methods including bumping. We can evaluate your current locks and explain the differences between standard and high-security options. Remember that locks are just one part of home security - strong locks combined with good doors, strike plates, and security practices create the best protection.
