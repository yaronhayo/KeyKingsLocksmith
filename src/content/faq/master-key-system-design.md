question: "How does a master key system work for businesses?"

A master key system allows different keys to open different locks while a single master key opens all locks in the system. This gives you flexible access control: employees get keys that only open their specific work areas, supervisors get keys that open multiple areas they oversee, and management gets master keys that open everything. More complex systems include sub-master keys for different departments or levels, and grand master keys for multi-building facilities or property management companies. Properly designed master key systems improve security, simplify key management, and reduce the number of keys people need to carry.

However, master key systems require professional design and installation. Poor design can create security vulnerabilities where unauthorized keys work in locks, or where lost keys compromise large portions of the system. The locks in a master key system must be compatible with master keying (not all locks are), and the pin configurations must be carefully planned to avoid accidental cross-keying. You also need strict key control to prevent unauthorized duplication - master key systems work best when combined with restricted keyways that can't be copied without authorization.
