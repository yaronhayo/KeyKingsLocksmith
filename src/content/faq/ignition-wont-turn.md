Yes, we can diagnose and fix ignition problems. Common causes include a worn key, damaged ignition cylinder, or steering wheel lock engaged. Sometimes the issue is as simple as debris in the ignition or a worn key that needs replacement. In other cases, the ignition cylinder itself needs repair or replacement. We'll examine your ignition, identify the problem, and provide the most cost-effective solution. We can also make new keys if yours are worn, and we carry ignition cylinders for many common vehicles for immediate replacement if needed.
