question: "What is a strike plate and why does it matter?"

The strike plate is the metal plate on your door frame where the deadbolt or latch enters when you lock your door. It's one of the most critical components of your door security, yet most homes have inadequate strike plates. Standard strike plates are small, thin, and attached with short screws that only go into the door frame, not the wall studs. When someone kicks a door, it's usually the strike plate that fails, not the lock itself.

Upgrading to a high-security strike plate is one of the most cost-effective security improvements you can make. Heavy-duty strike plates are thicker, larger (typically 3-4 inches long), and install with 3-inch screws that anchor deep into the wall studs behind the frame. Some strike plates have reinforced box designs that distribute force across a larger area. This simple upgrade can increase your door's resistance to forced entry by 10 times or more. We typically recommend strike plate upgrades whenever we install new locks or deadbolts. It's a small investment that makes a huge difference in how well your locks actually protect your home.
