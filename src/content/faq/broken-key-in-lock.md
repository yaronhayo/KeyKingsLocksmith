Don't try to remove it yourself - you might push it deeper or damage the lock. Call us at (864) 900-9597. We have specialized extraction tools designed to safely remove broken keys from locks without damaging the lock mechanism. Once we extract the broken piece, we'll make you a new key and check the lock to ensure it's working properly. If the lock was damaged when the key broke, we can repair or replace it on the spot. We carry common lock types on our service vehicles for immediate replacement if needed.
