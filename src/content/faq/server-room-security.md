Server rooms and data centers require multi-layered security because they contain critical IT infrastructure, confidential data, and expensive equipment. Physical security starts with the door: solid core or metal doors, commercial-grade locks or electronic access control, and limited key or credential distribution. Electronic access control is ideal for server rooms because it provides audit trails showing exactly who entered and when, allows instant credential revocation if an employee leaves or loses access privileges, and can trigger alerts if unauthorized access attempts occur or if the door is propped open.

Beyond the door lock, consider additional security layers: motion sensors or cameras inside the server room, environmental monitoring for temperature and water leaks, cabinet locks on server racks to prevent unauthorized equipment removal or tampering, and secure key boxes or lock boxes for backup access in emergencies. Many compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX) require specific physical security controls for areas containing sensitive data or systems. Regular access audits and limiting access to only essential personnel reduces risk.
