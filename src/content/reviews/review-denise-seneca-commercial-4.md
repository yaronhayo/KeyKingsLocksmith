Our warehouse manager accidentally locked the only set of keys inside the facility on a Sunday morning when we had an urgent shipment deadline. Key Kings responded within 25 minutes and had us back inside without any damage to the door or lock. Their quick response literally saved us from missing a major delivery commitment.
