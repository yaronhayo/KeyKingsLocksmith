The main entrance lock to our auto repair shop was malfunctioning for weeks, making it difficult to secure the building properly. Key Kings diagnosed the problem quickly and had the parts needed to repair it on their truck. Their technician explained exactly what was wrong and how to prevent future issues. Great service at a reasonable price.
