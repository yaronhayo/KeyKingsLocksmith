Our nonprofit organization needed to upgrade from traditional keys to an access control system to better manage volunteer and staff access to our facility. Key Kings provided an affordable solution that allows us to easily add or remove users and track building access. The system has greatly improved our security and accountability while being user-friendly for our volunteers.
