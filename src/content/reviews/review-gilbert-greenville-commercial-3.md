Running a restaurant means fire code compliance is critical. Key Kings installed panic bars on all our emergency exits, ensuring we meet all safety regulations while maintaining security. The installation was done during our closed hours, and they provided all the necessary documentation for our inspection. Highly professional service from start to finish.
