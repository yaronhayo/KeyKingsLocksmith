## üì± Testing Locally First

Before deploying, test locally:

1. Make sure `.env` has all keys
2. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Test address autocomplete on http://localhost:3000
4. If it works locally, it will work on Vercel (after adding env vars there)

If you don't have all keys yet, add them in this order:

### Must Have (Site Won't Work Without):
1. ‚úÖ `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Already added!
2. `RESEND_API_KEY` - For email notifications

### Important (Prevents Spam):
3. `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
4. `GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`

### Nice to Have:
5. Email configuration
6. Business information

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Address Autocomplete Not Working?
- Check Google Maps API key is added to Vercel
- Check Places API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Check API key restrictions allow your domain
- Check browser console for errors

### Forms Not Sending Email?
- Check Resend API key is added to Vercel
- Check FROM_EMAIL domain is verified in Resend
- Check email quota hasn't been exceeded

### reCAPTCHA Badge Not Showing?
- This is intentional - we use an inline notice instead
- Check `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` is set
