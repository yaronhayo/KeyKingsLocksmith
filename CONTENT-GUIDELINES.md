# Content Optimization & Authority Guidelines

## Content Strategy for Maximum Authority & Trust

### 1. Consumer-First Content Principles

#### Answer User Intent Completely
- **Address the full customer journey** from awareness to decision
- **Answer questions before they're asked** with comprehensive FAQ sections
- **Provide specific, actionable information** rather than generic statements
- **Use real examples and scenarios** that customers can relate to
- **Include pricing guidance** without specific amounts (to avoid policy violations)

#### Build Reassurance Through Transparency
- **Explain your process** step-by-step for each service
- **Share your qualifications** and certifications prominently
- **Provide clear timelines** without making unrealistic promises
- **Show real customer experiences** through detailed testimonials
- **Display credentials** and licensing information visibly

#### Establish Authority Through Expertise

### 2. Google Policy Compliance Framework

#### Prohibited Content to Avoid

- **False urgency** (avoid countdown timers or artificial scarcity)

#### Compliant Content Alternatives
```
❌ "We'll be there in 15 minutes guaranteed!"
✅ "Our average response time is 30 minutes throughout our service area"

❌ "Cheapest locksmith in town!"
✅ "Competitive pricing with upfront estimates and no hidden fees"

❌ "Best locksmith service - #1 rated!"
✅ "Highly rated locksmith service with over 1,000 satisfied customers"

❌ "Emergency special - 50% off if you call now!"
✅ "Professional emergency service available 24/7 at standard rates"
```
