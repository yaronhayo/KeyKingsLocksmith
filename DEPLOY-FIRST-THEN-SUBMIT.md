# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Deploy Before Submitting to Search Engines

## The Issue

You're getting "couldn't fetch" errors when trying to submit the sitemap to Google Search Console because:

**The site hasn't been deployed yet!**

Sitemaps are generated during the build process and only exist on the live production site, not in development mode.

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Order of Operations

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel (Do This First!)

1. **Commit all changes to Git:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add sitemap configuration and SEO optimizations"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy
   - **OR** if already connected, just push to GitHub and Vercel auto-deploys

3. **Wait for deployment to complete** (usually 2-3 minutes)

4. **Verify your site is live:**
   - Visit: https://keykingslocksmithsc.com
   - Check sitemap: https://keykingslocksmithsc.com/sitemap.xml
   - Check robots.txt: https://keykingslocksmithsc.com/robots.txt

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

Before the site works fully, add your API keys to Vercel:

1. Go to your project on Vercel
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Add these variables:
   ```
   PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_google_maps_key
   PUBLIC_GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_recaptcha_site_key
   GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_recaptcha_secret_key
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
   TO_EMAIL=keykingslocksmithsc@gmail.com
   ```
4. Click **Save**
5. Redeploy the site (Vercel ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Redeploy)

### Step 3: THEN Submit to Search Engines

**Only after the site is live and deployed**, submit to search engines:

1. **Google Search Console:**
   - URL: https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Submit sitemap: `https://keykingslocksmithsc.com/sitemap.xml`

2. **Bing Webmaster Tools:**
   - URL: https://www.bing.com/webmasters
   - Submit sitemap: `https://keykingslocksmithsc.com/sitemap.xml`

3. **Google Business Profile:**
   - URL: https://www.google.com/business/
   - Complete your business listing

## üîç Why This Happens

- **Development mode** (`npm run dev`): Site runs locally, no sitemap generated
- **Production build**: Astro generates sitemap during `astro build`
- **Vercel deployment**: Runs build automatically and serves the sitemap

The sitemap **only exists** on your deployed production site, not in local development.
