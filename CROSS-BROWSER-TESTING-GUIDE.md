## Automated Testing Script

Create a test script to check basic functionality across browsers:

```javascript
// scripts/cross-browser-test.js
const pages = [
  '/',
  '/services',
  '/services/emergency-locksmith',
  '/services/residential-locksmith',
  '/services/commercial-locksmith',
  '/services/automotive-locksmith',
  '/service-areas',
  '/faq',
  '/reviews',
  '/about',
  '/contact',
  '/book-service'
];

async function testPage(url) {
  console.log(`Testing: ${url}`);
  
  const checks = {
    loads: false,
    noErrors: false,
    hasTitle: false,
    hasH1: false,
    hasNav: false,
    hasFooter: false
  };
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    checks.loads = response.ok;
    
    const html = await response.text();
    checks.hasTitle = html.includes('<title>');
    checks.hasH1 = html.includes('<h1');
    checks.hasNav = html.includes('<nav');
    checks.hasFooter = html.includes('<footer');
    checks.noErrors = !html.includes('error');
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error testing ${url}:`, error);
  }
  
  return checks;
}

async function runTests() {
  const baseUrl = process.env.TEST_URL || 'http://localhost:4321';
  
  console.log(`Testing site at: ${baseUrl}\n`);
  
  for (const page of pages) {
    const results = await testPage(`${baseUrl}${page}`);
    console.log(results);
    console.log('---');
  }
}

runTests();
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Layout breaks on specific browser
**Solution**: Check for browser-specific CSS prefixes, use autoprefixer

### Issue: Fonts don't load on Safari
**Solution**: Verify font-display: swap, check CORS headers

### Issue: Sticky header jumps on iOS
**Solution**: Use position: -webkit-sticky along with position: sticky

### Issue: Click events don't work on iOS
**Solution**: Add cursor: pointer to clickable elements

### Issue: Form inputs zoom on focus (iOS)
**Solution**: Ensure font-size is at least 16px

### Issue: Horizontal scroll on mobile
**Solution**: Check for fixed-width elements, use max-width: 100%

### Issue: Images don't load on slow connections
**Solution**: Implement progressive loading, optimize image sizes

### Issue: Animations are janky
**Solution**: Use transform and opacity only, enable GPU acceleration
