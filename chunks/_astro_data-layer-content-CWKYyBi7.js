This situation poses security risks (someone could drive away with your car), environmental concerns (wasted fuel and emissions), and potential safety hazards depending on where the vehicle is running. Call us immediately at (864) 900-9597 and inform us that your keys are locked in a running vehicle - we’ll treat this as a priority emergency.</p>\n<p>While waiting for our technician to arrive, stay with your vehicle at all times if it’s safe to do so. Don’t leave a running car unattended, even for a few minutes. If your vehicle is in a dangerous location like an active roadway or if you feel unsafe, call local police for assistance as well. In cold weather, there’s less urgency than in summer heat, but it’s still important to resolve the situation quickly.</p>\n<p>Our technicians are equipped to unlock running vehicles quickly and safely using professional tools that won’t damage your car’s locking mechanism. Once we have you back in your vehicle, we can also make a spare key on the spot to prevent this situation from happening again. Many newer vehicles have safety features that prevent locking keys inside while running, but older models are more susceptible to this frustrating scenario.</p>",{headings:3007,localImagePaths:3008,remoteImagePaths:3009,frontmatter:3010,imagePaths:3011},[],[],[],{question:3000,category:2281,order:2645,featured:18},[],"keys-in-running-car.md","key-copying-near-me",{id:3013,data:3015,body:3018,filePath:3019,digest:3020,rendered:3021,legacyId:3029},{question:3016,category:2263,order:3017,featured:63},"Where should I get spare keys made?",16,"While hardware stores and kiosks offer quick key copying, professional locksmiths provide more accurate duplicates, especially for high-security keys, car keys, or keys with complex patterns.

Try holding the fob directly against the start button - many vehicles have a backup reader in that location for when the battery is low.\n\nOther potential causes include the brake pedal not being fully depressed (most cars require this for safety), a problem with the steering wheel lock mechanism, or the key fob losing its programming. In some cases, the issue is with the car's starter system, battery, or security system rather than the key itself. Dashboard warning lights or error messages can provide important clues about what's causing the problem.\n\nWe can diagnose push-button start issues and determine whether the problem is with your key fob, the vehicle's start button module, or another component of the system.

The most common cause is a dead or dying key fob battery, which prevents the car’s system from recognizing that an authorized key is present. Even if your fob has enough power to unlock the doors, it might not have sufficient charge for the push-button start system to detect it. Try holding the fob directly against the start button - many vehicles have a backup reader in that location for when the battery is low.</p>\n<p>Other potential causes include the brake pedal not being fully depressed (most cars require this for safety), a problem with the steering wheel lock mechanism, or the key fob losing its programming. In some cases, the issue is with the car’s starter system, battery, or security system rather than the key itself. Dashboard warning lights or error messages can provide important clues about what’s causing the problem.</p>\n<p>We can diagnose push-button start issues and determine whether the problem is with your key fob, the vehicle’s start button module, or another component of the system.
