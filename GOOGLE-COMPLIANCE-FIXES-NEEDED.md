## üéØ WHY THIS MATTERS

**Google's Spam Policy explicitly prohibits:**
1. ‚ùå Claiming licensing in jurisdictions that don't require it (SC doesn't license locksmiths)
2. ‚ùå Making specific response time guarantees you can't verify
3. ‚ùå Making absolute pricing guarantees ("no hidden fees")
4. ‚ùå Making unverifiable performance claims ("100% guaranteed")

**Consequences of non-compliance:**
- Google Business Profile suspension or removal
- Loss of Google Maps visibility
- Loss of Google Search visibility
- Significant revenue impact

## ‚úÖ COMPLIANT ALTERNATIVES

| ‚ùå DON'T SAY | ‚úÖ DO SAY |
|--------------|-----------|
| Licensed | Bonded & Insured / Professional |

| 24/7 | Emergency service during business hours |
| No hidden fees | Clear pricing discussed before work |
